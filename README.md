# Precipitation-Response-Analysis

Objectives:
Use pulses of water as a tracer much the same way as a traditional flourescent dye.
Pulses of water include monsoon precipitation events that flash through the groundwater system and snowmelt events that are triggered by warming surface temperatures.
Determine response times of these pulses via sliding-window cross-correlation through the North Kaibab Plateau to Roaring Springs
See if methodology can be used to also determine travel paths of pulses.
PRISM dataset consists of daily precip and surface temp values measured at 136 locations/pixels on the Kaibab Plateau. Run sliding window correlations using for loop for each location with the hydrograph to see which locations correlate the best. Exploratory and doesn't provide great resolution, but might be able to at least inform future dye traces.
Conduct Precipitation Reponse Analysis via SARIMAX model, Support Vector Machines, or Artificial Nueral Networks. Maybe limited by data or models maybe too complicated. If so, perform linear systems analysis or lumped parameter models. Purpose is to simulate response of spring and to determine conduit-to-fracture/matrix coupling and what variables (EVT, soil moisture, saturation of system through previous precip events) play a role in the response of the spring.
